The inventory is displayed first.
The user is prompted to enter in the ID of the item that they would like to purchase.
Then the user is prompted to enter in the quantity of the item that they would like to purchase.
The application then checks to see if it is in stock. If a sufficient amount of the item is in stock, then the user may purchase it. The application will give them their total. If there is not a sufficient amount of the item in stock then the user will recieve a message saying sorry there isnt enough of the item.
